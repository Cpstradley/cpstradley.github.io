        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Caroline Stradley is an Entertainment Technology student at BRCC, 
            concentrating in Audio Engineering. She is, first and foremost, 
            a singer/songwriter, and is hoping to ride that train into her future. 
            She has about 14,000 jobs, so she has no time for hobbies, friends, or "fun," 
            whatever those are. She just writes music about depression and unrequited love, 
            watches "Supernatural" on Netflix, and hopes she has enough money to pay her bills 
            and feed her cats every month.</p>
