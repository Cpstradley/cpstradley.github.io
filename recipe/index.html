                <p>Do you loathe cooking dinner? Does cooking take up too much of your lazy, post-work TV time?</p>
                <p>So much so that you would rather starve than force your body to slide off the couch and slither into the kitchen?</p>
                <p><em><strong>Boy</strong></em>, do I have the recipe for you!</p> 
                <p>This taco recipe literally takes 20 minutes. <strong>Total.</strong> <em>You're welcome.</em></p>
            <h2><strong>Here we go</strong></h2>
            <h3>Be an adult and go to your nearest grocery store and buy these things.</h3>
            <h4><em>We both know you don't have this stuff in your fridge already.</em></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>2lbs ground beef</li>
                    <li>1 can tomato soup</li>
                    <li>12 taco shells (warm 'em up in the oven)(or don't, I'm not your mom)</li>
                    <li>shredded lettuce</li>
                    <li>shredded cheese (Cheddar is the best choice,<em> obviously</em>, but you do you)</li>
                    <li>Hot sauce</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Slap on your apron and don't burn yourself while you do the following:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Brown the beef in a skillet over medium-high heat, stir the whole time to separate the meat. Season to taste.</li>
                <li>Drain the fat and dispose of it properly so you don't clog up your sink drain (you're welcome).</li>
                <li>Add the soup to the beef, stir and heat to a boil, then reduce heat to low and cook until soup is reduced. (Please stir it.)</li>
                <li>Divide this mixture among the taco shells.</li>
                <li>Top with cheese, lettuce, and hot sauce.</li>
                <li>Eat all 12 tacos by yourself in front of the TV because that's the point of all of this.</li>
            </ol>
